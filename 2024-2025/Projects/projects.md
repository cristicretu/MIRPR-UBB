    <summary> 1. Early Discovery of Anxiety/Depression in Teenagers Using Digital Tools </summary>

### Scop
Anxiety/Depression for teenagers - To enhance mental health support for teenagers by developing digital tools that can proactively identify signs of anxiety and depression. These tools aim to engage with adolescents in their digital environments—whether through chatbots, social media, video games, or other innovative platforms—to provide early intervention and emotional support. 

### Ideea de baza
The Early Discovery of Anxiety/Depression in Teenagers solution leverages digital platforms to identify and monitor mental health challenges among adolescents. The system combines multiple approaches, including AI-powered chatbots capable of conversational analysis, sentiment evaluation through social media interactions, and mental health assessments embedded in video game experiences. By engaging teenagers where they spend most of their time—whether online or gaming—the system aims to provide real-time insights and early warnings of anxiety or depression. This integrated solution offers a holistic approach, blending digital engagement with predictive analytics and personalized intervention strategies.

    <summary> 4. Support in the drug development  </summary>

### Scop
Predict the Actions of Substances on the Human Body - To develop a high-fidelity system capable of accurately predicting the actions and reactions of substances within the human body, starting with their interactions with proteins, ultimately advancing drug discovery and personalized medicine. 

### Ideea de baza
The Predict the Actions of Substances system aims to use computational biology and machine learning to model and predict the behavior of various substances at the molecular level. By focusing initially on how these substances interact with proteins, the system will provide insights into potential therapeutic or harmful effects, facilitating early-stage drug discovery and safety testing. Leveraging vast datasets of molecular structures and biological reactions, the solution will deliver predictive simulations and data analytics, helping researchers and healthcare providers understand substance-protein interactions before human trials or clinical use.

    <summary> 10. SimQuery </summary>

### Scop
- To query a ground truth database (in order to retrieve information using natural language The result of the query can be actual relevant data stored in the GT or it can be generated content using data summarization or other techniques. 
- To identify if a piece of information is supported by the GT The support detection process should allow for the system to automatically detect ground truth information which supports a certain piece of information 

### Ideea de baza
Improve operational efficiency, fosters innovation, strengthens decision making and gives organization a powerful tool for gaining insights from its data 

Facilitate collaboration between different domains by highlighting how ideas in one area may apply to another, fostering cross functional innovation 

Ground Truth represents a public data considered as being the correct and comprehensive representation of a certain reality 

Piece of information is defined as a generic information ( with no definite size and no 

definite content or ideas It can be a fragment of a page, a page, a document or a collection of documents 

Support  -definition- an information supports another information if there is a certain semantically similarity (topic similarity) and both information express the same idea(s)

### Scop
Identificarea cauzelor insuficientei mitrale

### Ideea de baza

Plecand de la o ecografie cardiaca (in format DICOM) se doreste identificarea cauzelor insuficientei mitrale (Mitral Regurgitation - MR). Se va folosi un model AI bazat pe Graph-based CNN care va analiza ecografia, iar pe baza masuratorilor (volumul MR, volumul ventriculului stang, volumul atriului stang, volumul inelului mitral, etc) si vor identifica interdependentele existente intre aceste masuratori (efectuate de-a lungul a mai multe cicluri cardiace).
